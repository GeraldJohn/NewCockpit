# NewCockpit
X-Plane Cockpit based on Teensy3.1 board

Based mainly on code from Jack Deeth (https://github.com/JDeeth/SimObjectsDev) I try to get 
my control box running to avoid using the mouse in X-Plane cockpits.
Using several switches, push buttons, leds and three Lcds all connected to a teensy 3.1 board by PJRC via several Ic's 
i'm trying to get the functionality of onboard switches and actuators to my box.
It's an ongoing projects with sometimes long periodes of no changes due to spare time and mood.
